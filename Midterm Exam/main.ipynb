    "CORRECTNESS:\n",
    "The code works correctly. The helpers package and its modules run without errors. Both functions (shout and area) give the right results. The use of module is quite convenient beacuse you can just import it anywhere possible. \n",
    " Reference : Lecture_7 - The concept of modules was in page 2. It explains the four main advantage of using modules\n",
    "\n",
    "COMPLEXITY:\n",
    "The code is simple.The funtions area simply returns the product and the shout simply retruns upprcase version of the string. The logic is clear and there are no extra steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "READABILITY:\n",
    "The code is easy to read and understand. Function and variable names make sense (area, shout, su, mu). The folder and file structure is organized.\n",
    "Reference : Lecture_7 - Module files name must be valid Python identifiers \n",
    "\n",
    "ROBUSTNESS:\n",
    "The code works for normal inputs but doesn’t check for wrong input types (like numbers instead of strings). Adding simple checks could make it stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "FAITHFULNESS:\n",
    "The code does what the task asked: it has a package with two modules, each module has a function, and it shows two ways to import them. It also talks about namespace collisions, but doesn’t show an actual example of a collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "NAMESPACE COLLISION EXPLANATION:\n",
    "If two modules have functions or variables with the same name, importing both directly into the same namespace can overwrite one of them an this will create a namespace collision. Th way to solve it is to use aliasses\n",
